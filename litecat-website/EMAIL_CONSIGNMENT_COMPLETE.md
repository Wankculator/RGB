## üîÑ Payment Flow with Email

### 1. Invoice Creation:
```javascript
// User submits RGB invoice
POST /api/rgb/invoice
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "rgbInvoice": "rgb:utxob:...",
  "batchCount": 5
}

// Email sent with Lightning invoice
```

### 2. Payment Confirmation:
```javascript
// Lightning payment detected
// RGB consignment generated
// Email sent with:
- Payment confirmation
- Consignment file attachment
- Download link backup
```

## üì® Email Features

### Lightning Invoice Email:
- Invoice ID and amount
- Lightning invoice string
- 30-minute expiry warning
- Payment instructions
- Mobile-friendly layout

### Payment Confirmation Email:
- Success confirmation
- Token amount
- Download button
- Consignment file attachment

## üß™ Testing

### Test Script Created:
```bash
node scripts/test-email-consignment.js
```

**Note**: Requires `npm install` to work

### Manual Testing:
1. Configure SendGrid in `.env`:
   ```env
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-api-key
   EMAIL_FROM=noreply@rgblightcat.com
   ```

2. Test invoice creation:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/rgb/invoice \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "rgbInvoice": "rgb:utxob:test",
       "batchCount": 1
     }'
   ```

## üîê Security Considerations

### Email Security:
- Consignment files are base64 encoded
- Attachments have unique filenames
- Download links expire after 7 days
- No sensitive data in email body

### Data Protection:
- Consignment stored encrypted in database
- Email addresses not logged in production
- Rate limiting on email endpoints
- Attachment size limits enforced

## üöÄ Production Checklist

### Before Going Live:
- [ ] Configure SendGrid API key
- [ ] Set proper FROM email address
- [ ] Test with real email addresses
- [ ] Verify attachment delivery
- [ ] Check spam folder placement
- [ ] Monitor email delivery rates

### SendGrid Configuration:
```javascript
// config.js
email: {
  sendgridApiKey: process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY,
  from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM || 'noreply@rgblightcat.com',
  fromName: 'LIGHTCAT',
  supportEmail: 'support@rgblightcat.com'
}
```
