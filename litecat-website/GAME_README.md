## Installation for Blender Integration

To convert the LIGHTCAT logo to a full 3D model using Blender MCP:

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Blender 3.0+
# Install Python 3.10+
# Install uv package manager
pip install uv
```

### Blender MCP Setup
1. Download `addon.py` from https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp
2. In Blender: Edit ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí Install
3. Select the addon.py file
4. Enable "Interface: Blender MCP"

### Logo to 3D Workflow
1. **Convert PNG to SVG**
   ```bash
   # Use online converter or Illustrator
   # Set to Black and White Logo preset
   ```

2. **Import in Blender**
   - File ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg)
   - Add Solidify modifier for depth
   - Apply subdivision surface

3. **Export for Three.js**
   - Export as GLTF 2.0
   - Optimize with Draco compression
   - Place in `/client/models/`

## Running the Game

1. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   cd litecat-website
   python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory client
   ```

2. **Access the game**
