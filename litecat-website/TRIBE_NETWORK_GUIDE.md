# 🌐 Tribe Wallet Network Guide

## ✅ Your Current Status
- **Asset**: LIGHTCAT (21M tokens)
- **Asset ID**: `rgb:uQsgEYWo-T6mnwCS-N6mH90J-w6fAeQJ-p53B8gj-UKIY7Po`
- **Network**: MAINNET (Real Bitcoin) ✅

## 📍 How to Check/Change Network in Tribe Wallet

### Finding Network Settings:

1. **From Main Screen**:
   - Look for hamburger menu (☰) or three dots (⋮)
   - Tap "Settings" or gear icon (⚙️)

2. **In Settings Menu**:
   - Look for one of these options:
     - "Network"
     - "Bitcoin Network"
     - "Developer Options"
     - "Advanced Settings"
     - "Node Configuration"

3. **Network Options You Might See**:
   - **Bitcoin (Mainnet)** ← You're here (real network)
   - **Bitcoin (Testnet)** ← Test network
   - **Bitcoin (Signet)** ← Another test network
   - **Bitcoin (Regtest)** ← Local testing

### Visual Indicators:
- **Mainnet**: Usually orange/yellow Bitcoin logo
- **Testnet**: Often green or has "TESTNET" label
- **Different address format**:
  - Mainnet: addresses start with `bc1`
  - Testnet: addresses start with `tb1`

## 🎯 Since You're on Mainnet

This is perfect! Your real LIGHTCAT tokens are on the production network. You DON'T need to switch to testnet.

### Why This Matters:
- **Mainnet** = Real value, real transactions
- **Testnet** = Just for testing, no real value
- Your 21M LIGHTCAT tokens have real value on mainnet

## 📬 Now Get a Sample RGB Invoice

Since we confirmed you're on mainnet, let's get that sample invoice:

1. **Go back to your LIGHTCAT token screen**
   - You should see your 21M balance

2. **Tap "Receive" or receive icon (↓)**
   - This generates an invoice for others to send you tokens

3. **Make sure it's RGB format**:
   - Should show "RGB Invoice" or "RGB Address"
   - NOT regular "Bitcoin Address"

4. **The invoice will look like**:
   ```
   rgb:utxob:2PY7Rp-gLKiHb1n-MfLEcm5-iFR5BfG-KgXwW8X-XgLTtTL-AYjdGo
   ```
   Or similar format starting with `rgb:`

5. **Copy and share it**
   - This is just a receive address (safe to share)
   - It's how buyers will send their invoices to you

## 📋 What I Have So Far:

✅ **Asset ID**: `rgb:uQsgEYWo-T6mnwCS-N6mH90J-w6fAeQJ-p53B8gj-UKIY7Po`
✅ **Network**: Mainnet
❓ **Need**: Sample RGB invoice (from Receive button)

## 💡 Quick Tips:

- You DON'T need to find testnet since your tokens are on mainnet
- Mainnet is the correct network for selling real tokens
- Each RGB invoice is unique (changes each time)
- The invoice format helps me understand how Tribe generates them
