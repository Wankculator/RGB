# 💰 LIGHTCAT Fund Flow Explanation

## 🎯 Where Are The Funds Going?

Great question! Here's exactly how the Lightning payments flow through the LIGHTCAT system:

## 📍 Fund Destination Overview

**Lightning payments go to your Voltage Lightning node**, not directly to a Bitcoin address. Here's the complete flow:

### 1️⃣ Payment Collection (Lightning Layer)
```
Customer pays Lightning invoice → Voltage Lightning Node receives payment
```

When someone buys LIGHTCAT tokens:
- They pay a Lightning invoice (e.g., 2,000 sats per batch)
- The payment goes to **your Voltage Lightning node**
- The funds accumulate in your Lightning node's wallet

### 2️⃣ Current Configuration

Looking at your `.env` file:
```
LIGHTNING_NODE_URL=https://lightcat.m.voltageapp.io:8080
```

This means:
- Your Voltage node at `lightcat.m.voltageapp.io` receives all payments
- The funds are held in your Lightning node's wallet
- You control these funds through your Voltage dashboard

### 3️⃣ Bitcoin Address in Config

You might have noticed:
```
BTC_WALLET_ADDRESS=bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh
```

**This address is NOT where Lightning payments go!** It's used for:
- Display purposes in the UI
- Future on-chain payment options (if implemented)
- Fallback information

## 💸 How to Access Your Funds

### From Voltage Lightning Node:

1. **View Balance in Voltage Dashboard**
   ```
   Login to voltage.cloud → Your Node → Wallet → Balance
   ```

2. **Withdraw to On-Chain Bitcoin**
   ```
   Voltage Dashboard → Wallet → Send → On-Chain
   Enter your Bitcoin address (e.g., bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh)
   ```

3. **Keep as Lightning Balance**
   - Use for Lightning payments
   - Open channels with other nodes
   - Provide liquidity

2. Go to your node dashboard
3. Click on "Wallet"

### Automated Withdrawal Script:
```bash
# Create automated withdrawal script
cat > scripts/withdraw-funds.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Withdraw Lightning funds to Bitcoin address

AMOUNT=$1
DEST_ADDRESS="${BTC_WALLET_ADDRESS:-bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh}"

# Use Voltage API to withdraw
node scripts/voltage-withdraw.js $AMOUNT $DEST_ADDRESS
EOF
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **Lightning Funds are Hot Wallet**
   - Keep only operational amounts
   - Withdraw excess regularly

2. **Your Voltage Credentials Control Access**
   - Keep admin.macaroon secure
   - Never share API credentials

3. **Cold Storage Best Practices**
   - Use hardware wallet for large amounts
   - Multi-sig for business funds

```bash
# In Voltage Dashboard
Transactions → Filter by "Received"
