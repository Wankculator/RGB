# üöÄ LIGHTCAT - IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

## üéØ Your Platform Status: 65% Complete

**What's Ready**: The entire platform is built and running locally  
**What's Missing**: Real service connections and your configuration

## üìã INFORMATION NEEDED FROM YOU

Please provide these 4 items:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Your Bitcoin Wallet Address
```
Current: bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh
Your address: _______________________________
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Payment Method Choice
```
[ ] Option A: Voltage Lightning ($26.99/mo, manual withdrawals)
[X] Option B: BTCPay Server ($6.99/mo, automatic to your wallet) ‚Üê RECOMMENDED
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Your Domain Name
```
Example: lightcat.com or tokens.yoursite.com
Your domain: _______________________________
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ RGB Seed Phrase Status
```
[ ] I have the 24-word seed phrase ready
[ ] I need to create a new RGB wallet
```

## üé¨ EXACT STEPS TO LAUNCH (In Order)

### Phase 1: Payment Setup (30 min)

**If BTCPay (Recommended):**
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/sk84l/Downloads/RGB\ LIGHT\ CAT/litecat-website
./scripts/setup-btcpay-voltage.sh

# This will:
# - Guide you through BTCPay setup
# - Connect to your Bitcoin wallet
# - Enable automatic payments
```

**If Voltage:**
```bash
# You already have this partially set up
# Just need to upgrade from trial
```

### Phase 2: Database Setup (15 min)

```bash
# 1. Create free account at supabase.com
# 2. Create new project
# 3. Get your keys from Settings > API
# 4. Run:
./scripts/setup-supabase.sh
```

### Phase 3: RGB Wallet Setup (10 min)

```bash
# Import your seed phrase securely:
./scripts/setup-rgb-wallet.sh

# This will:
# - Import your wallet
# - Check LIGHTCAT balance
# - Set up automated distribution
```

### Phase 4: Final Configuration (5 min)

```bash
# Update your wallet address:
nano .env

# Change this line:
BTC_WALLET_ADDRESS=your_real_bitcoin_address_here

# Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)
```

### Phase 5: Test Everything (20 min)

```bash
# Test payment flow:
node scripts/test-payment-flow.js

# Test full user experience:
node scripts/test-full-user-flow.js

# If all tests pass, you're ready!
```

### Phase 6: Deploy to Production (45 min)

```bash
# Quick deploy to your VPS:
./scripts/quick-deploy.sh YOUR_VPS_IP root YOUR_DOMAIN

# This handles everything:
# - Uploads code
# - Installs dependencies
# - Configures SSL
# - Starts services
```

## üî• FAST TRACK (If You Want to Launch TODAY)

### Minimal Setup (1 hour):
1. Use Voltage (already set up)
2. Use mock RGB for now
3. Deploy to VPS
4. Add real services later

### Commands:
```bash
# 1. Update wallet address
nano .env
# Change: BTC_WALLET_ADDRESS=your_address

# 2. Deploy immediately
./scripts/quick-deploy.sh YOUR_VPS_IP root YOUR_DOMAIN

# 3. Your site is live!
```

## ‚ö° CRITICAL DECISIONS

### Decision 1: Payment Processor
- **Voltage**: Easier but custodial (they hold funds)
- **BTCPay**: Slightly more setup but YOU control funds ‚Üê BETTER

### Decision 2: Launch Strategy
- **Option A**: Launch with mocks, upgrade later (FASTEST)
- **Option B**: Set up everything properly first (BEST)

### Decision 3: RGB Tokens
- **With seed**: Can distribute real tokens immediately
- **Without seed**: Use mock tokens until ready

## üìä Time to Launch

**Fastest Path** (with minimal setup): 1 hour  
**Recommended Path** (with BTCPay + real services): 3 hours  
**Everything Perfect** (all services + testing): 4-5 hours

## üéØ What I Need From You NOW
