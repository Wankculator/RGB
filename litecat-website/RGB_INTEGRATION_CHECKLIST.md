# üî¥ RGB Token Integration Checklist

## üìã What We Need From Your RGB Wallet

### 1. **RGB Asset Information**
Please provide:
- **Asset ID**: The RGB asset ID for LIGHTCAT tokens (looks like: `rgb:2bFVTT-qGmxxPDh-...`)
- **Contract ID**: The RGB contract identifier
- **Asset Schema**: Which RGB schema (RGB20, RGB21, etc.)
- **Total Supply**: Confirm 21,000,000 tokens
- **Precision**: Decimal places (usually 0 for meme tokens)

### 2. **RGB Node Details**
- **RGB Node URL**: Where is your RGB node running?
- **Node Type**: RGB-NODE, RGB Core, or other?
- **Network**: Testnet or Mainnet?
- **API Access**: Do you have API keys/credentials?

### 3. **Current Token Distribution**
- **Wallet Address**: Your RGB-compatible Bitcoin address holding the tokens
- **Available Balance**: How many tokens are available for sale?
- **UTXO Information**: Which UTXOs hold the RGB tokens?

### 4. **Technical Setup**
Do you have:
- [ ] RGB node running and synced?
- [ ] Access to create consignments?
- [ ] Ability to sign PSBTs?
- [ ] Bitcoin node for UTXO management?

## üîß Integration Steps

### Step 1: Configure Asset Details
```bash
# Update .env with your real RGB asset
RGB_ASSET_ID=<your-actual-asset-id>
RGB_CONTRACT_ID=<your-contract-id>
RGB_NODE_URL=<your-rgb-node-url>
RGB_NODE_API_KEY=<if-required>
```

### Step 2: Invoice Format
RGB invoices typically look like:
- `rgb:utxob:<blinded_utxo>@<transport_endpoints>`
- `rgb:<invoice_data>`

**Question**: What format does your RGB wallet use for invoices?

### Step 3: Consignment Generation
When someone pays, we need to:
1. Receive their RGB invoice
2. Create a consignment file with the token transfer
3. Sign the transfer with your wallet
4. Deliver the consignment file

**Question**: Can your RGB node create consignments via API, or do we need to use command-line tools?

### Step 4: Transfer Authorization
- How do you authorize transfers from your wallet?
- Do you have signing keys accessible to the server?
- Or do you prefer manual approval for each transfer?

## üö® Security Considerations

### Option 1: Automated Transfers (Convenient but requires trust)
- Server has access to sign transfers
- Automatic token distribution
- Requires secure key management

### Option 2: Semi-Automated (Recommended)
- Server creates unsigned transfers
- You sign them periodically
- Batch processing possible

### Option 3: Manual Approval (Most secure)
- Each purchase requires your approval
- You manually create consignments
- Maximum security, less convenient

## üí° Quick Questions

1. **Do you have RGB CLI tools installed?** (rgb-node, rgb-cli, etc.)
2. **Can you generate a test invoice from your wallet?**
3. **What's the exact command/process you use to transfer tokens?**
4. **Do you want to test on testnet first or go straight to mainnet?**
