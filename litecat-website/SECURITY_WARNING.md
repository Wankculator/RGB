# 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING

## NEVER Share Your Seed Phrase!

### ❌ What NOT to Share:
- **Seed phrase / Recovery words** (12-24 words)
- **Private keys**
- **Wallet passwords**
- **Backup files**

### ✅ What's SAFE to Share:
- **Asset ID** (public identifier)
- **RGB invoices** (for receiving only)
- **Public addresses**
- **Transaction IDs**
- **Network type** (mainnet/testnet)

## 🔒 Why This Matters

Your seed phrase gives COMPLETE access to:
- All your Bitcoin
- All your RGB tokens
- Ability to steal everything
- No way to reverse if compromised

## 🎯 What We Actually Need

I only need PUBLIC information:
1. **Asset ID** - This is public, like a token's name
2. **Sample invoice** - Just to see the format
3. **Network type** - Mainnet or testnet

## 📱 Safe Way to Get Info from Tribe Wallet

1. **Open Tribe Wallet yourself**
2. **Navigate to LIGHTCAT token**
3. **Copy only the Asset ID**
4. **Share that publicly-safe information**

### Example of SAFE information:
```
Asset ID: rgb:2bFVTT-qGmxxPDh-X3Bq2Tw-xVbZZ1n-fxT3V7E-F9A842E6
Network: Mainnet
Invoice format: rgb:utxob:...
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

1. **Store seed phrase offline** (paper, metal)
2. **Never type it online**
3. **Never screenshot it**
4. **Never share with ANYONE**
5. **Even support staff don't need it**

## 💡 Think of it This Way

- **Seed phrase** = Your bank vault combination
- **Asset ID** = Your business card
- **RGB invoice** = Your payment request

Only share the business card and payment requests, never the vault combination!

**Your tokens are safe as long as you keep your seed phrase private. Let's work with just the public information instead!**
