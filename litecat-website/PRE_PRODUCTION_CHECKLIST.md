## üîÑ Ready for Real RGB Testing

### Next Steps:
1. **Replace Mock Services**
   ```javascript
   // In server/app.js or server/services/rgbService.js
   const USE_MOCK = process.env.USE_MOCK_RGB === 'true';
   
   if (USE_MOCK) {
     // Current mock implementation
   } else {
     // Real RGB node integration
   }
   ```

2. **Connect Real Lightning Node**
   - Update `LIGHTNING_NODE_URL` in .env
   - Ensure macaroon and TLS cert paths are correct
   - Test with small amounts first

3. **Connect Real RGB Node**
   - Update `RGB_NODE_URL` in .env
   - Configure RGB asset ID
   - Test consignment generation

4. **Database Setup**
   - Ensure Supabase is connected
   - Run migrations if needed
   - Test data persistence

## üìã Test Scenarios for RGB Integration

### Scenario 1: Basic Purchase
1. Enter valid RGB invoice
2. Create Lightning invoice
3. Pay Lightning invoice
4. Verify consignment generation
5. Download and verify consignment file

### Scenario 2: Game Integration
1. Play game and score 28+ (Gold tier)
2. Click "GO TO PURCHASE"
3. Verify 10 batches pre-selected
4. Complete purchase flow

### Scenario 3: Error Handling
1. Test invalid RGB invoice format
2. Test expired Lightning invoice
3. Test insufficient payment
4. Test network interruption

### Scenario 4: Performance
1. Test with multiple concurrent users
2. Monitor response times
3. Check memory usage
4. Verify rate limiting

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Checklist

- [ ] Enable HTTPS for production
- [ ] Set secure CORS origins
- [ ] Enable Helmet security headers
- [ ] Review all API endpoints for auth
- [ ] Test SQL injection attempts
- [ ] Test XSS attempts
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works

## üìä Monitoring Setup

- [ ] Configure uptime monitoring
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Configure backup strategy
- [ ] Set up alert notifications

## üö¶ Go/No-Go Criteria
- ‚úÖ All payment flows tested
- ‚úÖ Security measures in place
- ‚úÖ Error handling verified
- ‚úÖ Performance acceptable
- ‚úÖ Backup plan ready
